# Testing in local dev
*Scenario: You want to use local version of `@shopee-rn/dummy-builder` in `@shopee/rn-bundle-deployment` which resides in host repo.*

Step 1: `cd` into `ib-builder-repo/packages/dummy-builder`.
Step 2: `yarn link`
Step 3: `cd` into `host-repo/packages/rn-bundle-deployment`
Step 4: `yarn link @shopee-rn/dummy-builder`

# Testing on jenkins
*Scenario: You want to test builder-repo changes without publishing pre-release versions of packages.*

Step 1: Finalize code changes and check `package-loader` config (init & packages) in builder-repo root `package.json` is correct.
Step 2: Commit and push changes to branch.
Step 3: Now go to the host jenkins job and fill in `BUILDER_REPO_BRANCH` with the branch in step 2.
Step 4: Trigger build job

# Publishing

## Add a changeset
`pnpm changeset`

This command will ask you a series of questions, first about what packages you want to release, then what semver bump type for each package, then it will ask for a summary of the entire changeset. At the final step it will show the changeset it will generate, and confirm that you want to add it.

Once confirmed, the changeset will write a Markdown file that contains the summary and YAML front matter which stores the packages that will be released and the semver bump types for them.

### You can add more than one changeset to a pull request

Changesets are designed to stack, so there's no problem with adding multiple. You might want to add more than one changeset when:

- You want to release multiple packages with different changelog entries
- You have made multiple changes to a package that should each be called out separately

# Releasing beta versions
